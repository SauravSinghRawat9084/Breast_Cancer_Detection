# 🧠 Breast Cancer Detection using Histopathology Images

This project focuses on detecting breast cancer using histopathology images with deep learning models. We used a dataset from Kaggle and implemented classification using pre-trained CNN architectures (VGG16, ResNet50) and hyperparameter tuning with Keras Tuner.

## 🧠 Model Architectures

### 🔍 Keras Tuner
Keras Tuner helps with automatic hyperparameter optimization. It supports techniques like:
- Random Search
- Bayesian Optimization
- Hyperband

### 📦 Pretrained Models

#### ✅ VGG16
- Known for its uniform and simple 3x3 convolution architecture.
- Performs well on a wide range of image classification tasks.

#### ✅ ResNet-50
- Introduces *residual learning* which improves training for deeper networks.
- Achieves strong performance on medical image datasets.
